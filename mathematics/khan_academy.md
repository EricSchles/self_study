Today I start my journey into mathematics.  I will start with Khan Academy to remember the learning I started with as a child.

I finished kindergarden and first grade.  

What I covered:

* counting
* addition
* word problems
* basic bar chart interpretation.

An interesting metric - count the total area of each bar as a magnitude.  
We already have density measures in matplotlib, but perhaps overall magnitude of the "universe" being considered is a helpful metric in certain circumstances.
