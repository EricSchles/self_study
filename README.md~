# Self Study

The goal of this course will be self study.  It is intended for me, but you are free to follow it as well.  I will merely be documenting my personal learning journey here.
In the spirit of open source, I will being making it publicly available.  I don't intend on any pedagogy, nor intuition.  I will keep things at a level that is suitable for me.
If you can't keep up or something doesn't make sense to you, I don't care.  In other parts of this account, I will make every attempt to explain myself clearly.
But this repo and set of materials is for me to learn, at my pace, not anyone elses.  If something is missing or unclear, too bad.  You can always fork the repo and add it yourself.
I will accept no Pull Requests and I will make no changes based on the feedback of others.

In other words, if you don't like what I've written or what I will likely write, too bad.

## The Content

The intention of this material is to prepare myself for my job and for my personal goals outside of work, specifically being helpful.  I have done things in the past, but my skills have degraded.
So this is an attempt to recover my skills and to do so on my terms.  I will be obsessed with this until I feel confident in where I am at.

### Mathematics

For this section I will be going up to category theory, starting at basic mathematics.  I will assume I know nothing and move to a place where I am ready for category theory.
